### Tracking Functional Development

[x] Dagger architecture for shared activity. 
[] Navigation graph gets our app up and running with empty fragment
[] LocationHelper gets our user's location and accessible in ViewModel
[] Structure YelpRepository and queried calls to get burrito joints with user's location
[] We pass down our results to our listview
[] Selecting an item we set it in our shared ViewModel and pull it down in map view
